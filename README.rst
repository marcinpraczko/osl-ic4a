===================
IC4A - Main details
===================

``IC4A`` - stands for **Interactive Console 4 Automation**.

Writing this tool was caused by having more and more chellanges related with repeating quickly tasks
which I am doing every day (Searching for files, creating templates for scripts, analysing scripts,
checking code, automation, configuration manager, etc).

**Goal:**

- Create software which can work like ``git`` (init, prepare, ansilble) - using many arguments and do
  some actions with this commands.
- Track changes in once folder (HOME directory) and allow me work much more effectivly.
- Have modular (if possible) strcuture.
- Workflow similar like Metasplit / DAC / routersploit / etc.
